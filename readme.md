# Beakdown
This is a game about birds. Build a nest and defend it from the other birds.

This game was made in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2019 using the theme _What home means to you_.

## Objective
The objective of the game is to collect items for your bird's nest. Each item added will add to your score. After **1 minute** the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.

### Values and weight
Each item has a _value_ and a _weight_. There are three levels of value:

* **Normal items** are worth _10 points_. (Bills, Gum, Pebbles, Sticks, Straws)
* **Shinny items** are worth _20 points_. (Bombs, Bottles, Pizza)
* **Sparkling items** are worth _40 points_. (Hubcaps, Lipsticks, Rings)

Each item also has a different weight. The heavier the item, the slower you are

### Your beak
You pick up items by stabbing them with your beak. You can hold the `attack` button to charge up a longer attack which let's you cover a longer range. You can also pick up multiple items at the same time. 

#### PVP
You may also use your beak to attack the other player. You will be stunned and pushed away if you get struck by an attack.

#### Stealing
You may try to sabotage for the other player by stealing some items from his/her nest. Just keep in mind that your nest is vulnerable while you do this. You're also unable to steal every item at once
